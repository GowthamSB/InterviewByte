2. There is a 200 miles long tunnel. one train enters the tunnel at a speed of 200mph<br />
while the other trains enter the tunnel in the opposite direction at a speed of 1000 mph. A<br />
bee travels at a speed of 1500 mph enters the tunnel goes to and back until it reaches the<br />
train. What is the distance covered by the bee when the two train collides (the bee<br />
survives)<br />
<br />
3. List the two advantages of views.<br />
<br />
4. Which layer is encryption and decryption done<br />
<br />
5. What are the various modes used to send data over the network<br />
<br />
6. Write a query to display the name of the students whose total marks is divisible by 25<br />
(total marks may be 175, 200, 150...)<br />
<br />
7. P(S1)<br />
a++;<br />
P(S2)<br />
v++;<br />
V(S2)<br />
V(S1)<br />
P-wait, V-signal, S1 and S2 are semaphores. Consider two threads running. Is there a<br />
deadlock .If yes in which situation does the deadlock occur.<br />
<br />
8. How do you find the port number of the remote host?<br />
<br />
Date; who&gt;logfile<br />
What is the difference between the two statements.<br />
<br />
10. How do you find the machine MAC address<br />
<br />
11. How many children did not try any of the rides. ?<br />
<br />
(55-20=)35 kids * 2 rides = Rs. 70<br />
60 + 70 = Rs. 130<br />
So, Rs. (145  130 = ) 15 are left for the other (85  55 = ) 30 kids . so only 15 of them<br />
can take a ride and rest 15 will be left out.<br />
145 rides were taken. 20 of them took all three, i.e. Rs. 60 were spent, so 145-60= Rs. 85<br />
are left for the others. Total kids were 85, so rest were 65. out of these 65,<br />
<br />
12. How many children took exactly one ride?<br />
<br />
13. Four cities are connected by a road network as shown in the figure. In how many<br />
ways can you start from any city and come back to it without travelling on the same road<br />
more than once ?<br />
<br />
Consider the top city, the following are the 3 routes possible, starting from the leftmost<br />
edge. Since there are 3 edges emanating from each city and the figure is perfectly<br />
symmetrical, these 3 routes are possible from each edge, hence for any given city, the<br />
total number of routes = 4 * 3 = 12.<br />
<br />

<br />
A, B, and C are three numbers, Let<br />
@(A, B)= Average of A and B<br />
