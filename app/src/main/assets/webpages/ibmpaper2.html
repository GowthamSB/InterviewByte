<p>About Matrix Test :&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the new pattern of IBM. This new pattern has been implemented. It contains 3 sections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>i) Section A</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some information is given in the form of matrices, with headings for rows as row1, row2 . Etc. For columns with headings as column1, column 2. Etc. Those matrices are as follows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


	Row1 @ * 2 Z
	Row2 S K ? $
	Row3 I P Z +
	Row4 # 8 F Q


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Questions are as follows ( not same questions but same type):&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. After giving similar type of conditions , what is the element left to H? In this section they gave around 4 matrices of this type and gave some questions for each matrix.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. 5s then which column elements sum equals to 9?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. If column1 , Column 4 are interchanged and row3 , row4 are interchanged and diagonal elements from top left to bottom right are written in reverse order then what is the element in row1 and column 1?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. If a company produces 15 different model of tv sets of 2 inchs screen and 4 different model of 4 inches screen size. Then how many model should vendor has for all the model so that all models willdisplayed in the showroom?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. If a team consists 20 members in which 20% are mathematician then how many member should they hire so that the ratio would become 10/11.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. If Zs in odd numbered rows are replced with 7s and Ss in odd numbered columns are replaced with.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Section B&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All questions in this section are from number series. Total number of questions are 20.Time limit is 4 minutes. These are also multiple choice questions( 5 options). Negative marking(1/4) is there for this section.&nbsp;</p>
